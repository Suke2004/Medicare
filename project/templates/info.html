                    Since the dawn of the dark ages, groundbreaking discoveries have been made by mankind. Research is a vital aspect of every field. The Research and Development (R&D) Cell thrives on the synergy between young minds and experienced faculty. Established to promote and oversee the research programs of the institute, the cell administers and coordinates these programs. Our goal is to foster a research culture within the college by encouraging innovative research in emerging and challenging areas of Engineering, Technology, Science, and Humanities. Faculty and students are motivated to be creative, as creativity sparks new ideas. We conduct lectures and demonstrations by our faculty and experts, alongside paper presentations and workshops, to ignite the spirit of innovation among students.
