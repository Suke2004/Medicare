# Medical Recommendation System

The **Medical Recommendation System** is an intelligent healthcare assistant designed to provide personalized medical guidance based on user symptoms. Using **Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor)**, it predicts suitable medicines, offers dietary recommendations, and provides a nearby hospital locator, ensuring quick access to medical assistance.

## 🏥 Features

- **Symptom-Based Medicine Recommendation**: Predicts the most suitable medicines using Machine Learning.
- **Dietary Suggestions**: Recommends diet plans to aid recovery and overall health.
- **Nearby Hospital Locator**: Helps users find healthcare facilities based on their location.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Flask**, making it accessible even for non-technical users.
- **Holistic Healthcare Approach**: Empowers users with quick, data-driven medical advice.
- **Decision-Support for Professionals**: Can assist healthcare professionals in preliminary diagnoses.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Regressor)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **APIs**: Google Maps API (for hospital locator)
- **Database (Optional)**: CSV/JSON-based storage for symptom-disease mapping
